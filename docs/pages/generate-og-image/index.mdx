## How it works

The extension uses the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) template engine to inject the query parameters sent with the request into the template you provide during the extension setup, and then it uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to render the output and take a screenshot of it and return as a response.

Here is a simple and fully working example of a Handlebars template:

```html
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
```

And here is a simple example of a request that will render the template above:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://your-function-url.here?title=Hello%20World'
```

## Features

### Fully customizable templates

You can use any HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript to create your templates. Use any font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) or any other font service.

### Markdown Support

You can use Markdown to format your text. The extension uses [marked](https://marked.js.org/) to parse the Markdown.

### Support for different Emoji styles

Customize emoji style either per template or even per request. Currently, [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) is the only supported style, but more styles will be added in the future.
