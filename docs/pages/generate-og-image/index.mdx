## How it works

The extension uses the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) template engine to inject the query parameters sent with the request into the template you provide during the extension setup, and then it uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to render the output and take a screenshot of it and return as a response.

Here is a simple and fully working example of a Handlebars template:

```html
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
```

And here is a simple example of a request that will render the template above:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://your-function-url.here?title=Hello%20World'
```
