## ‚úèÔ∏è Introduction

**Connect Firestore Document** (`firestore-connect-document`) is a new extension for Firebase that allows you to get some fields from one document in Firestore, store them in a `map` field in another document, and keep them in sync.

![Connect Firestore Document Firebase Extension demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35961879/201526571-b0106cb1-36f4-4a46-9b96-0d96e5aca39a.gif)

For example, you can use this extension to user profile information (such as `name`, `email`, and `photoURL`) from their document in the `users` collection and store it in the `createdBy` field of each document created by that user in the `posts` collection.

This is a very common pattern in Firestore data modeling and is usually done _manually_ by writing and deploying custom Cloud Functions to handle each case. This extension automates this process for you. It allows you to implement this pattern with just a few clicks and without writing any code directly from the Firebase console.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Fully customizable field names.
- ‚úÖ Customize what happens when the source document is deleted
- ‚úÖ Optionally get _all_ fields from the source document or just _some of them_.
- üöß Extend the extension functionality using events.

## üß© Install the extension

To install the extension, follow the steps on the [Install a Firebase Extension](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/install-extensions) page. In summary, do one of the following:
