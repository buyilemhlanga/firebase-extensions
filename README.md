# Connect Firestore Document

## ‚úèÔ∏è Description

**Connect Firestore Document** (`firestore-connect-document`) is a new extension for Firebase that allows you to get some fields from one document in Firestore, store them in a `map` field in another document, and keep them in sync.

For example, you can use this extension to user profile information (such as `name`, `email`, and `photoURL`) from their document in the `users` collection and store it in the `createdBy` field of each document created by that user in the `posts` collection.

This is a very common pattern in Firestore data modeling and is usually done _manually_ by writing and deploying custom Cloud Functions to handle each case. This extension automates this process for you. It allows you to implement this pattern with just a few clicks and without writing any code directly from the Firebase console.
